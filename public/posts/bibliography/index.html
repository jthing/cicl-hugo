The IR uses a directed graph with labeled vertices and ordered inputs but unordered outputs. Vertices are labeled with opcodes, edges are unlabeled. We represent the CFG and basic blocks with the same vertex and edge structures. Each opcode is defined by a C++ class that encapsulates opcode-specific data and behavior. We use inheritance to abstract common opcode behavior, allowing new opcodes to be easily defined from old ones. The resulting IR is simple, fast and easy to use.},

  urldate = {2024-03-03},
  abstract = {In functional programming, continuation-passing style (CPS) is a style of programming in which control is passed explicitly in the form of a continuation. This is contrasted with direct style, which is the usual style of programming. Gerald Jay Sussman and Guy L. Steele, Jr. coined the phrase in AI Memo 349 (1975), which sets out the first version of the Scheme programming language.John C. Reynolds gives a detailed account of the numerous discoveries of continuations.A function written in continuation-passing style takes an extra argument: an explicit &#34;continuation&#34;; i.e., a function of one argument.  When the CPS function has computed its result value, it &#34;returns&#34; it by calling the continuation function with this value as the argument. That means that when invoking a CPS function, the calling function is required to supply a procedure to be invoked with the subroutine&#39;s &#34;return&#34; value.  Expressing code in this form makes a number of things explicit which are implicit in direct style.  These include: procedure returns, which become apparent as calls to a continuation; intermediate values, which are all given names; order of argument evaluation, which is made explicit; and tail calls, which simply call a procedure with the same continuation, unmodified, that was passed to the caller. Programs can be automatically transformed from direct style to CPS. Functional and logic compilers often use CPS as an intermediate representation where a compiler for an imperative or procedural programming language would use static single assignment form (SSA). SSA is formally equivalent to a subset of CPS (excluding non-local control flow, which does not occur when CPS is used as intermediate representation). Functional compilers can also use A-normal form (ANF) (but only for languages requiring eager evaluation), rather than with &#39;thunks&#39; (described in the examples below) in CPS.  CPS is used more frequently by compilers than by programmers as a local or global style.},

@article{durandRemovingRedundantTests,
  title = {Removing Redundant Tests by Replicating Control Paths},
  author = {Durand, Irène and Strandh, Robert},
  abstract = {We describe a technique for removing redundant tests in intermediate code by replicating the control paths between two identical tests, the second of which is dominated by the first. The two replicas encode different outcomes of the test, making it possible to remove the second of the two. Our technique uses local graph rewriting, making its correctness easy to prove. We also present a proof that the rewriting always terminates. This technique can be used to eliminate multiple tests that occur naturally such as the test for consness when both car and cdr are applied to the same object, but we also show how this technique can be used to automatically create specialized versions of general code, for example in order to create fast specialized versions of sequence functions such as find depending on the type of the sequence and the values of the keyword arguments supplied.},

  abstract = {In order to simplify the compilation process, many compilers for higher-order languages use the continuationpassing style (CPS) transformation in a rst phase to generate an intermediate representation of the source program. The salient aspect of this intermediate form is that all procedures take an argument that represents the rest of the computation (the \textbackslash continuation&#34;). Since the na ve CPS transformation considerably increases the size of programs, CPS compilers perform reductions to produce a more compact intermediate representation. Although often implemented as a part of the CPS transformation, this step is conceptually a second phase. Finally, code generators for typical CPS compilers treat continuations specially in order to optimize the interpretation of continuation parameters.},
