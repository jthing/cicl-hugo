  abstract = {We present a graph-based intermediate representation (IR) with simple semantics and a low-memory-cost C++ implementation. The IR uses a directed graph with labeled vertices and ordered inputs but unordered outputs. Vertices are labeled with opcodes, edges are unlabeled. We represent the CFG and basic blocks with the same vertex and edge structures. Each opcode is defined by a C++ class that encapsulates opcode-specific data and behavior. We use inheritance to abstract common opcode behavior, allowing new opcodes to be easily defined from old ones. The resulting IR is simple, fast and easy to use.},

  urldate = {2024-03-03},
  abstract = {In functional programming, continuation-passing style (CPS) is a style of programming in which control is passed explicitly in the form of a continuation. This is contrasted with direct style, which is the usual style of programming. Gerald Jay Sussman and Guy L. Steele, Jr. coined the phrase in AI Memo 349 (1975), which sets out the first version of the Scheme programming language.John C. Reynolds gives a detailed account of the numerous discoveries of continuations.A function written in continuation-passing style takes an extra argument: an explicit "continuation"; i.e., a function of one argument.  When the CPS function has computed its result value, it "returns" it by calling the continuation function with this value as the argument. That means that when invoking a CPS function, the calling function is required to supply a procedure to be invoked with the subroutine's "return" value.  Expressing code in this form makes a number of things explicit which are implicit in direct style.  These include: procedure returns, which become apparent as calls to a continuation; intermediate values, which are all given names; order of argument evaluation, which is made explicit; and tail calls, which simply call a procedure with the same continuation, unmodified, that was passed to the caller. Programs can be automatically transformed from direct style to CPS. Functional and logic compilers often use CPS as an intermediate representation where a compiler for an imperative or procedural programming language would use static single assignment form (SSA). SSA is formally equivalent to a subset of CPS (excluding non-local control flow, which does not occur when CPS is used as intermediate representation). Functional compilers can also use A-normal form (ANF) (but only for languages requiring eager evaluation), rather than with 'thunks' (described in the examples below) in CPS.  CPS is used more frequently by compilers than by programmers as a local or global style.},

@article{deanTrainingCompilersBetter,
  title = {Training {{Compilers}} for {{Better Inlining Decisions}}},
  author = {Dean, Jeffrey and Chambers, Craig},
  abstract = {Optimizing implementations for object-oriented languages rely on aggressive inlining to achieve good performance. Sometimes the compiler is over-eager in its quest for good performance, however, and inlines too many methods that merely increase compile time and consume extra compiled code space with little benefit in run-time performance. We have designed and implemented a new approach to inlining decision making in which the compiler performs inlining experimentally and records the results in a database that can be consulted to guide future inlining decisions of the same routine at call sites that have similar static information. Central to our approach is a new technique, called type group analysis, that calculates how much of the static information available at a call site was profitably used during inlining. The results of type group analysis enable the compiler to compute a generalization of the actual static information for a particular experiment, significantly increasing reuse of database entries. Preliminary results indicate that compile time is almost cut in half with only a 15\% reduction in run-time performance.},

  abstract = {We describe a technique for removing redundant tests in intermediate code by replicating the control paths between two identical tests, the second of which is dominated by the first. The two replicas encode different outcomes of the test, making it possible to remove the second of the two. Our technique uses local graph rewriting, making its correctness easy to prove. We also present a proof that the rewriting always terminates. This technique can be used to eliminate multiple tests that occur naturally such as the test for consness when both car and cdr are applied to the same object, but we also show how this technique can be used to automatically create specialized versions of general code, for example in order to create fast specialized versions of sequence functions such as find depending on the type of the sequence and the values of the keyword arguments supplied.},

  abstract = {In order to simplify the compilation process, many compilers for higher-order languages use the continuationpassing style (CPS) transformation in a rst phase to generate an intermediate representation of the source program. The salient aspect of this intermediate form is that all procedures take an argument that represents the rest of the computation (the \textbackslash continuation"). Since the na ve CPS transformation considerably increases the size of programs, CPS compilers perform reductions to produce a more compact intermediate representation. Although often implemented as a part of the CPS transformation, this step is conceptually a second phase. Finally, code generators for typical CPS compilers treat continuations specially in order to optimize the interpretation of continuation parameters.},

Instead of solving refinement constraints with an SMT solver like DML and Liquid Haskell, our system requires and permits programmers to embed proofs of properties within the program text, letting us support a rich logic of properties including quantifiers and induction. We show that the type system is sound by showing that every refined program erases to a simply-typed program, and by means of a denotational semantics, we show that every erased program has all of the properties demanded by its refined type. All of our proofs are formalised in Lean 4. CCS Concepts: • Theory of computation → Program verification; Denotational semantics.},

  author = {Hölzle, Urs and Chambers, Craig and Ungar, David},
  abstract = {SELF’s debugging system provides complete source-level debugging (expected behavior) with globally optimized code. It shields the debugger from optimizations performed by the compiler by dynamically deoptimizing code on demand. Deoptimization only affects the procedure activations that are actively being debugged; all other code runs at full speed. Deoptimization requires the compiler to supply debugging information at discrete interrupt points; the compiler can still perform extensive optimizations between interrupt points without affecting debuggability. At the same time, the inability to interrupt between interrupt points is invisible to the user. Our debugging system also handles programming changes during debugging. Again, the system provides expected behavior: it is possible to change a running program and immediately observe the effects of the change. Dynamic deoptimization transforms old compiled code (which may contain inlined copies of the old version of the changed procedure) into new versions reflecting the current source-level state. To the best of our knowledge, SELF is the first practical system providing full expected behavior with globally optimized code.},
